Then the engine sees luci-rpc.getDHCPLeases,
  triage_operation now returns type =
  "dhcp_leases_read". Later, when the status
  callback succeeds, you can map that type to an
  action/category like any other:

  elseif operation.type == "dhcp_leases_read" then
      operation.action   = "getDHCPLeases"
      operation.category = "network"
      operation.config   = "dhcp"
      create_log_entries_for_operation(operation)

  Resulting KV log line (typical):

  Thu Nov 13 12:15:12 2025 [user: root]
  action=getDHCPLeases category=network
  config=dhcp result=success

  Same idea for luci-rpc.getSystemStat (map to
  action="getSystemStat" and category system) or
  your myapp_action.

  ### Quick comment you can add above the override
  block

  -- Example: extend triage for luci-rpc + custom
  services
  -- Each key is "object.method"; value is the
  internal type the engine should log.

  
  triage = {
      extra_types = {
          ["luci-rpc.getDHCPLeases"] =
  "dhcp_leases_read",
          ["luci-rpc.getSystemStat"] =
  "system_stat_read",
          ["myapp.doSomething"]      =
  "myapp_action",
      }
  }
